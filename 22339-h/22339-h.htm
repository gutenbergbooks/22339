<h3>"<span class="sc">Notes and Queries" in Holland</span>.</h3>

  <p>The following extremely interesting, and, we need scarcely add, to us
  most gratifying, communication reached us at too late a period last week
  to admit of our then laying it before our friends, readers, and
  contributors. They will one and all participate in our gratification at
  the proof which it affords, not merely of that success which they have
  all combined to secure, but of the good working, and consequent wide
  extension, of that great principle of literary brotherhood which it has
  been the great object of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" to
  establish.</p>

  <p><i>To the Editor of</i> "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>."</p>

  <p>Mr. Editor,</p>

  <p>We have the pleasure of sending you the prospectus of "<span
  class="sc">De Navorscher</span>," a new Dutch periodical, grounded upon
  the same principle as its valuable and valiant predecessor "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>." The title, when translated into
  English, would be&mdash;"<i>The Searcher; a medium of intellectual
  exchange and literary intercourse between all who know something, have to
  ask something, or can solve something.</i>" If it be glorious for
  <i>you</i> to have proposed a good example, we think it honourable for
  <i>us</i> to follow it.</p>

  <p>Though we do not wish to be our own trumpets, we can say that never a
  Dutch newspaper was greeted, before its appearance, by such favourable
  prognostics. <i>Your</i> idea, Mr. Editor, was received with universal
  applause; and Mr. <span class="sc">Frederik Muller</span>, by whom "<span
  class="sc">De Navorscher</span>" will be published, is not only a
  celebrated bookseller, but also one of our most learned
  <i>bookmen</i>.</p>

  <p>Ready to promote by every means in our power the friendly intercourse
  between your country and our fatherland, we desire of you to lay the
  following plan before the many readers of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>."</p>

  <p>1. Every Query, which, promulgated by our English sister, would
  perhaps find a solution when meeting the eyes of <i>Dutch</i> readers,
  will be <span class="scac">TRANSLATED</span> for them by her foreign
  brother. We promise to send you a version of the eventual answers.</p>

  <p>2. Of Queries, divulged in "<span class="sc">De Navorscher</span>,"
  and likely to be answered if translated for the British readers of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," a <i>version</i> will be presented
  by us to the sister-periodical.</p>

  <p>3. The title of <span class="sc">Books or Odd Volumes</span> wanted to
  purchase, of which copies may exist in the Netherlands, will be duly
  inserted into "<span class="sc">De Navorscher</span>" when required. Mr.
  <span class="sc">Frederik Muller</span> will direct his letters,
  containing particulars and lowest price, to the persons anxious for
  information.</p>

  <p>4. All communications for "<span class="sc">De Navorscher</span>" must
  be addressed to Mr. <span class="sc">D. Nutt</span>, Bookseller, <!--
  Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>No. 270.
  Strand; or, <i>carriage free</i>, to the "<i>Directors</i> of the same,"
  care of Mr. <span class="sc">Frederik Muller</span>, "Heerengracht, near
  the Oude Spieglestraat, Amsterdam."</p>

  <p>With a fervent wish that in such a manner, two neighbourly nations,
  connected by religion, commerce, and literary pursuits, may be more and
  more united by the mail-bearing sea which divides them, we have the
  honour to remain,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1">Mr. Editor,</p>
      <p class="i2">Your respectful servants,</p>
      <p><span class="sc">The Directors of "De Navorscher."</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Amsterdam, the 16th of December, 1850.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>When by the publication of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"
  we laid down those telegraphic lines of literary communication which we
  hoped should one day find their way into every library and book-room in
  the United Kingdom, we little thought that, ere fifteen months had
  passed, we should be called upon, not to lay down a <i>sub</i>marine
  telegraph, but to establish a <i>super</i>marine communication with our
  brethren in the Low Countries. We do so most gladly, for we owe them
  much. From them it was that Caxton learned the art, but for which "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" would never have existed; and of
  which the unconstrained practice has, under Providence, served to create
  our literature, to maintain our liberties, and to win for England its
  exalted position among the nations of the earth.</p>

  <p>Heartily, therefore, do we bid God speed to "<span class="sc">De
  Navorscher</span>;" and earnestly will we do all we can to realize the
  kindly wish of our Amsterdam brethren, that the "two neighbourly nations
  of Holland and England, connected by religion, commerce, and literary
  pursuits, may be more and more united by the mail-bearing sea which
  divides them."</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>SIR JOHN DAVIES AND HIS BIOGRAPHERS.</h3>

  <p>Sir John Davies, the "sweet poet" and "grave lawyer"&mdash;rather odd
  combinations by the bye,&mdash;according to Wood, was "born at Chisgrove,
  in the parish of Tysbury in Wiltshire, being the son of a wealthy
  <i>tanner</i> of that place!" This statement is repeated in Cooper's
  <i>Muses' Library</i>, p. 331.; Nichols's <i>Select Poems</i>, vol. i.,
  p. 276.; Sir E. Brydges's edition of Philips's <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i>,
  1800, p. 272.; Sir Harris Nicolas's edition of Davison's <i>Poetical
  Rhapsody</i>, vol. i. p. cii., &amp;c. And Headley, in his <i>Select
  Beauties of Poetry</i>, ed. 1787, vol. i. p. xli., adds, "he was a man of
  <i>low</i> extraction!" Wood's assertion concerning Davies's parentage,
  was made, I believe, upon the authority of Fuller; but it is undoubtedly
  an error, as the books which record the admission of the younger Davies
  into the Society of the Middle Temple, say the father was "late of New
  Inn, <i>gentleman</i>."</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert R. Pearce, in a recent work, entitled <i>A History of the
  Inns of Court and Chancery</i>, 8vo. 1848, p. 293., gives the following
  sketch of the leading facts in the life of our "poetical
  lawyer:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir John Davis, the author of <i>Reports</i>, and several other legal
  works, and a poet of considerable repute, was of this Society
  [<i>i.e.</i> the Middle Temple]. His father was a member of New Inn, and
  a practitioner of the law in Wiltshire. At the Middle Temple, young Davis
  became rather notorious for his irregularities, and having beaten Mr.
  Richard Martin (also a poet, and afterwards Recorder of London) in the
  hall, he was expelled the house. Afterwards, through the influence of
  Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, he was restored to his position in the Middle
  Temple; and, in 1601, was elected a Member of the House of Commons. In
  1603, he was appointed by King James Solicitor-General in Ireland. In
  1606, he was called to the degree of Serjeant-at-Law; and, in the
  following year, was knighted by the King at Whitehall. In 1612, he
  published a book on the state of Ireland, which is often referred to; and
  soon afterwards he was appointed King's Serjeant, and Speaker of the
  House of Commons in Ireland. On his return to England he published his
  reports of cases adjudged in the King's Court in Ireland,&mdash;the first
  reports of Irish cases made public. The preface to these reports is very
  highly esteemed. It has been said to vie with Coke in solidity and
  learning, and equal Blackstone in classical illustration and elegant
  language. Sir John Davis died 7th of December, 1626."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is amusing to see how erroneous statements creep into ordinary
  biography. Headley, as we have just seen, calls Davies "a man of
  <i>low</i> extraction;" and now we find a more recent biographer adding
  (without the shadow of an authority), "at the Middle Temple, young Davies
  became <i>rather notorious for his irregularities</i>!"</p>

  <p>Davies's quarrel with Richard Martin is alluded to by Wood. After
  speaking of his admission into the Middle Temple, and of his being made a
  barrister (July, 1595), that writer adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But so it was that he [Sir John Davies] being a high-spirited young
  man, did, upon some little provocation or punctilio, bastinado Rich.
  Martin (afterwards Recorder of London) in the Common Hall of the Middle
  Temple, while he was at dinner. For which act being forthwith [February,
  1597-8] expell'd, he retired for a time in private, lived in Oxon in the
  condition of a sojourner, and follow'd his studies, tho' he wore a cloak.
  However, among his serious thoughts, making reflections upon his own
  condition, which sometimes was an affliction to him, he composed that
  excellent philosophical and divine poem called <i>Nosce Teipsum</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is not a little singular that this very Richard Martin, whose
  chastisement is thus recorded, had <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>been on terms of strict
  friendship with our "high-spirited" young lawyer. In 1596, Davies had
  published his poem on dancing, entitled <i>Orchestra</i>, the title-page
  of which is followed by a dedicatory sonnet "To his very friend, Ma.
  Richard Martin." This sonnet is written in extravagant terms of
  friendship and admiration; and as it is only to be found in the
  <i>rare</i> first edition, and in the almost equally rare
  <i>Bibliographical Catalogue of the Ellesmere Collection</i>, some of
  your readers may not be displeased to see it on the present
  occasion:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"TO HIS VERY FRIEND MA. RICH. MARTIN.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To whom shall I this dauncing Poeme send,</p>
      <p class="i1">This suddaine, rash, halfe-capreol of my wit?</p>
      <p class="i1">To you, first mover and sole cause of it,</p>
      <p>Mine-owne-selves better halve, my deerest frend.</p>
      <p>O, would you yet my Muse some Honny lend</p>
      <p class="i1">From your mellifluous tongue, whereon doth sit</p>
      <p class="i1">Suada in majestie, that I may fit</p>
      <p>These harsh beginnings with a sweeter end.</p>
      <p class="i1">You know the modest sunne full fifteene times</p>
      <p>Blushing did rise, and blushing did descend,</p>
      <p class="i1">While I in making of these ill made rimes,</p>
      <p>My golden bowers unthriftily did spend.</p>
      <p class="i1">Yet, if in friendship you these numbers prayse,</p>
      <p class="i1">I will mispend another fifteene dayes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The cause of quarrel between the two young lawyers is not known, but
  the "offence," whatever it was, was not slight. In the year 1622, when
  Davies reprinted his poetical works, we find that his feelings of
  resentment against his once "very friend" had not abated, for in place of
  the dedicatory sonnet to Richard Martin, is substituted a sonnet
  addressed to Prince Charles; and at the conclusion of the poem, he left a
  <i>hiatus</i> after the one hundred and twenty-sixth stanza, on account
  of the same quarrel.</p>

  <p>Sir John Davies's celebrated poem, <i>Nosce Teipsum</i> (mentioned by
  Wood in the previous extract), is said to have gained the author the
  favour of James I., even before he came to the crown. Wood gives the
  precise period of its composition, and, I think, with every appearance of
  truth, although it does not accord with the statement of modern
  biographers, that it was written at twenty-five years of age. (See
  Campbell's <i>Essay on Poetry</i>, &amp;c., ed. 1848, p. 184.) The first
  edition of this poem was printed in 4to. in the year 1599, and has for
  its title the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>. This Oracle expounded in Two Elegies. 1. Of
  Humane Knowledge. 2. Of the Soule of Man, and the Immortalitie thereof.
  London, Printed by Richard Field, for John Standish. 43 leaves."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As I am deeply interested in all that relates to the subject of this
  note, I have compiled a list of editions of the above poem, which shows
  its popularity for more than a century and a half:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sir John Davies left behind him a large number of MSS. upon various
  subjects, none of which have since been printed. It would be very
  desirable that a list, as far as can now be made out, should be put on
  record. Anthony Wood says, several of Davies's MSS. were formerly in the
  library of Sir James Ware of Ireland and since that in the possession of
  Edward, Earl of Clarendon. The most interesting of these MSS. were a
  Collection of Epigrams, and a Metaphrase of David's Psalms. The Harleian
  MSS., Nos. 1578. and 4261., contain two law treatises of this learned
  writer, and in Thorpe's <i>Catalogue</i> for 1823, I find <i>A Treatise
  of Tenures touchinge his Majesties Prerogative Royal</i>, by John Davies,
  folio, MS.</p>

  <p>Granger does not record any engraved portrait of this writer, and all
  my enquiries have failed in discovering one. In Mr. Soame Jenyn's Hall,
  at Botesham, in Cambridgeshire (in 1770), was a full-length portrait of
  an elderly gentleman in a gown, with a book in one hand, on which is
  written "<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>." If this is a genuine portrait of Sir John
  Davies, it ought to be engraved to accompany a new edition of his
  poetical works; a publication which the lovers of our old poetry would
  deem an acceptable offering.</p>

<h3>A NOTE ON QUEEN ANN'S FARTHINGS.</h3>

  <p>The idea that a Queen Anne's farthing is a coin of the greatest
  rarity, originated perhaps in the fact that there are several <i>pattern
  pieces</i> executed by Croker, which are much valued by collectors, and
  which consequently bring higher prices. One type only was in circulation,
  and this appears to have been very limited, for it is somewhat scarce,
  though a specimen may easily be procured of any dealer in coins for a few
  shillings. This bears the bust of the <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>Queen, with the legend
  <span class="scac">ANNA DEI GRATIA</span>&mdash;reverse, <span
  class="scac">BRITANNIA</span> around the trite figure of Britannia with
  the spear and olive-branch: the date 1714 in the exergue. Those with
  Peace in a car, Britannia standing with olive-branch and spear, or seated
  under an arch, are patterns; the second has the legend <span
  class="scac">BELLO ET PACE</span> in indented letters, a mode revived in
  the reign of George III. It is said that many years ago a lady in the
  north of England lost one of the farthings of Queen Anne, which she much
  prized as the bequest of a deceased friend, and that having offered in
  the public journals a large reward for its recovery, it was ever
  afterwards supposed that any farthing of this monarch was of great
  value.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Lammer Beads.</i>&mdash;Does any one know the meaning of "Lammer
  beads?" They are almost always made of amber, and are considered as a
  charm to keep away evil of every kind; their touch is believed to cure
  many diseases, and they are still worn by many old people in Scotland
  round the neck. The name cannot have anything to do with "Lammermuir,"
  as, although they are well known among the old people of Lammermuir, yet
  they are equally so all over Scotland.</p>

  <p class="author">L. M. M. R.

  <p><i>On the Lingering of the Spirit.</i>&mdash;Perhaps you may think the
  following story worthy of insertion in your paper.</p>

  <p>There is a common belief among the poor, that the spirit will linger
  in the body of a child a long time when the parent refuses to part with
  it. I said to Mrs. B., "Poor little H. lingered a long time; I thought,
  when I saw him, that he must have died the same day, but he lingered
  on!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mrs. B., "it was a great shame of his mother. He wanted to
  die, and she would not let him die: she couldn't part with him. There she
  stood, fretting over him, and couldn't give him up; and so we said to
  her, 'He'll never die till you give him up.' And then she gave him up;
  and he died quite peaceably."</p>

  <p><i>Mottos on Warming-Pans and Garters.</i>&mdash;It seems to have been
  much the custom, about two centuries ago, to engrave more or less
  elaborately the brass lids of warming-pans with different devices, such
  as armorial bearings, &amp;c., in the centre, and with an inscription or
  a motto surrounding the device. A friend of the writer has in his
  possession three such lids of warming-pans, one of which has engraven on
  the centre a hart passant, and above his back a shield, bearing the arms
  of Devereux, the whole surrounded by this inscription:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="scac">"THE . EARLE . OF . ESSEX . HIS . ARMES."</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Another bears the arms of the commonwealth, (as seen on the coins of
  the Protectorate,) encircled with an inscription, thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="scac">"ENGLANDS . STATS . ARMES."</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The third bears a talbot passant, with the date above its back, 1646,
  and the motto round:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="scac">"IN . GOD . IS . ALL . MY . TRUST."</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It appears to me that the first two, at least, belonged to
  <i>inns</i>, known by the respective signs indicated by the mottos,
  &amp;c.; the first probably in honour of the Lord-General of the
  Parliament's army, who was the last Devereux bearing the title.</p>

  <p>That last described affords a curious illustration of a passage cited
  in Ellis's <i>Brand</i> (ed. 1849, vol. i. p. 245.), from <i>The Welsh
  Levite tossed in a Blanket</i>, 1691.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our <i>garters</i>, bellows, and <i>warming-pans</i> wore godly
  mottos," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In further illustration, I may mention that the owner of the
  warming-pans has in his possession likewise a beautifully manufactured
  long silk <i>garter</i>, of perhaps about the same date, in which are
  woven the following words:&mdash;</p>

<h3>NOTES ON JESSE'S "LONDON AND ITS CELEBRITIES."</h3>

  <p>During my perusal of Mr. Jesse's pleasant volumes, I marked two or
  three slips of the pen, which it may not be amiss to make a note of.</p>

  <p>In vol. i. pp. 403, 404, 405., there is a curious treble error
  regarding Thomas Sutton, the munificent founder of the Charter House. He
  is successively styled <i>Sir</i> Thomas, <i>Sir Richard</i>, and <i>Sir
  Robert</i>. Sutton's Christian name was Thomas. He was never knighted. Of
  the quaint leaden case which incloses his remains, and of its simple
  inscription, an accurate drawing, with accompanying particulars, by your
  able correspondent Mr. <span class="sc">E. B. Price</span>, was inserted
  in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i> for January, 1843, p. 43. The inscription runs
  thus: "1611. <span class="sc">Thomas Sutton, Esquiar</span>."</p>

  <p>Vol. ii. pp. 34, 35, 36. Mr. Jesse's ingenious suggestions relative to
  the tradition of the burial of Oliver Cromwell in Red Lion Square, merit
  the careful attention of all London antiquaries.</p>

  <p>Ib. p. 316.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is no evidence of Clement's Inn having been a Court of Law
  previous to 1486."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>For "a court of law," read "an inn of court." <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span></p>

  <p>Ib. p. 339. Erratum, line 9, in reference to Mrs. Garrick's reopening
  of her house, for the first time after her husband's decease&mdash;for
  "1701" read "1781," obviously a printer's error.</p>

  <p>Ib. p. 423.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cranmer's successor in the see of Canterbury was Archbishop
  Whitgift."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whitgift was <i>Grindal's</i> successor, and Grindal was preceded by
  Parker, who must be deemed Cranmer's successor. Cranmer perished in 1556.
  Parker was made archbishop in 1559.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jesse will not be angry, I am sure, with the above notes, or need
  any apology for an attempt to add to the value of his book.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Verstegan.&mdash;A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in
  Antiquities, concerning the most noble and renowned English Nation. By
  the Study and Travel of Richard Verstegan.</i>&mdash;There is something
  so sonorous and stately in the very sound of the title of Master Richard
  Verstegan's etymological treatise, that any bibliographical notice of it,
  I am sure, will find a corner in "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>." The following MS. note is on a fly-leaf of my copy,
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1655:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The first edition was printed at Antwerp, in 1605. A full account of
  this work is given in Oldys's <i>British Librarian</i>, pp. 299 312. It

  add those animadversions, in their proper places, which have been since
  occasionally made on some mistakes in it; as those made by Mr. Sheringham
  on his fancy of the <i>Vit√¶</i> being the ancient inhabitants of the Isle
  of Wight, &amp;c. But more especially should be admitted the corrections
  of the learned Mr. Somner, he having left large marginal notes upon
  Verstegan's whole book, as we are informed by Bishop Kennett, the late

  <p><i>George Herbert and the Church at Leighton Bromswold.&mdash;Little
  Gidding.</i>&mdash;Some of your readers may not be aware that George
  Herbert built the church of Leighton Bromswold, Hunts as well as that of
  Bemerton. The church stands about three-quarters of a mile to the right
  of the road from Huntingdon to Thrapston, and a view of it is given in
  Zouch's 4to. edition of Isaac Walton's <i>Lives</i>; it is stated, in a
  note, to be near Spalding, for which read <i>Spaldwick</i>. Herbert
  desired the pulpit and reading-desk to be placed on opposite sides of the
  church, and of the same height; to show that "preaching ought not to be
  esteemed above praying, nor praying above preaching."</p>

  <p>Query, What is the state of the interior <i>now</i>, as to pews,
  &amp;c.?</p>

  <p>The nuns, if I may so call them, in the monastery at Little Gidding,
  Hunts, employed themselves in covering or in ornamenting the covers of
  books, in patterns, with silver and coloured-silk threads: a friend of
  mine in Surrey has a small volume so ornamented by them.</p>

  <p><i>Essheholt Priory.</i>&mdash;Esholt Hall (now in the possession of
  W. R. C. Stansfield, Esq.) is the same as the ancient priory of
  Essheholt, which was under the abbot of Kirkstall.</p>

  <p>This priory fell, of course, with the smaller houses, and was valued
  at 19<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Essheholt remained in the crown till
  the first year of Edward VI., nine years after the dissolution, when it
  was granted to Henry Thompson, Gent., one of the king's gens-d'armes at
  Boulogne. In this family the priory of Esholt remained somewhat more than
  a century, when it was transferred to the neighbouring and more
  distinguished house of Calverley by the marriage of Frances, daughter and
  heiress of H. Thompson, Esq., with Sir Walter Calverley. His son, Sir
  Walter Calverley, Bart., built, on the site of the old priory, the house
  which now stands.</p>

  <p>Over a door of one of the out-buildings is an inscription in ancient
  letters, from which may be traced&mdash;"Aleisbet. Pudaci,
  p&mdash;&mdash;," with a bird sitting on the last letter p. (Elizabeth
  Pudsay, prioress).</p>

  <p>The builder of the present house died in 1749; and, in 1755, his son
  of the same name sold the manor-house and furniture to Robert Stansfield,
  Esq., of Bradford; from whom the present owner is descended.<a

  <p><i>Crossing Rivers on Skins</i> (Vol. iii., p. 3.).&mdash;Mr. C. M.
  G., a near relative of mine, who lately returned from naval service on
  the Indus, told me, last year, that he had often seen there naked natives
  employed in fishing. The man, with his fishing-tackle, launches himself
  on the water, sustained by a large hollow earthen vessel having a round
  protuberant opening on one side. To this opening the fisherman applies
  his abdomen, so as to close the vessel against the influx of water; and
  clinging to this air-filled buoy, floats about quite unconcernedly, and
  plies his fishing-tackle with great success. The analogy between this
  Oriental buoy and the inflated skins mentioned by Layard and by your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Janus Dousa</span>, is sufficiently
  remarkable to deserve a note.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. ii., p. 493.)</p>

  <p>(31.) P. H. F. (Vol. iii., pp. 24, 25.) has described a 12mo., or
  rather an 8vo., copy of Latin Psalter in his possession, and he wishes to
  know whether Montanus had any connexion with one of the translations
  therein exhibited. The title-page of your correspondent's volume will
  tell him precisely what the book contains. He had better not rely too
  much upon MS. remarks in any of his treasures; and when a bibliographical
  question is being investigated, let <i>Cyclop√¶dias</i> by all means not
  be disturbed from their shelves. Would it not be truly marvellous if a
  volume, printed by Robert Stephens in 1556, could in that year have
  presented, by prolepsis, to its precocious owner a version which Bened.
  Arias Montanus did not execute until 1571? But P. H. F.'s communication
  excites another query. He appears to set a special value upon his Psalter
  because that the verses are in it distinguished by cyphers; but Pagnini's
  whole Bible, which I spoke of, came thirty years before it, and we have
  still to go nearly twenty years farther back in search of the earliest
  example of the employment of Arabic figures to mark the verses in the
  Book of Psalms. The <i>Quincuplex Psalterium</i>, by Jacques le Fevre, is
  a most beautiful book, perhaps the finest production of the press of
  Henry Stephens the elder; and not only are the verses numbered in the
  copy before me, which is of the improved "secunda emissio" in 1513, but
  the initial letters of them are in red. At signature <span
  class="scac">A</span> iiij. there is a very handsome woodcut of the
  letter <span class="scac">A.</span>, somewhat of a different style, from
  the larger (not the Ascensian) <span class="scac">P.</span>, within the
  periphery of which St. Paul is represented, and which is so well worthy
  of notice in Le Fevre's edition of the <i>Epistole diui Pauli
  Apostoli</i>, Paris, 1517. The inquiry toward which I have been
  travelling is this, When did Henry Stephens first make use of the open
  Ratdoltian letter on dotted ground? (See Maitland's <i>Lambeth List</i>,
  p. 328. Dibdin's <i>Typog. Antiq.</i> vol. i., Prel. Disquis., p.
  xl.)</p>

  <p>(32.) Is there extant any collation of the various exemplars of the
  <i>Alphabetum divini Amoris</i>? And has an incontrovertible opinion been
  formed as to the paternity of this tract? For the common error of
  ascribing it to Gerson is entirely inexcusable, as this Parisian
  chancellor is frequently alleged therein. The third volume of his works,
  set forth by Du Pin, in 1706, contains this "Treatise of the Elevation of
  the Soul to God," and the editor has left the blunder uncorrected in his
  <i>Eccles. Hist.</i> iii. 53. Again, can it be affirmed that the folio
  impression of Louvain, (Panzer, ix. 243.), in which Gerson's name occurs,
  was assuredly anterior to the small black-letter and <!-- Page 87
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>anonymous
  editions, likewise without dates? Two of the latter (one much older than
  the other) are of 12mo. size, in 8vo., as is also Bonaventura's
  <i>Stimulus divini Amoris</i>, printed in 1510 and 1517.</p>

  <p>(33.) In what way can we detect the propounder of the <i>Notabilis
  expositio super canonem misse</i>? His work is of small folio size
  without mention of place or year; but it certainly proceeded from
  Nuremberg, and was it not one of the <i>primiti√¶</i> of Creusner?</p>

  <p>(34.) Who is designated by the letters "G. N. N. D.," which are put at
  the head of the Epistle to Zuinglius, <i>De Magistris nostris
  Lovaniensibus, quot et quales sint</i>? And why has the <i>Vita S.
  Nicolai, sive Stultiti√¶ Exemplar</i>, originally attached to this
  performance, been omitted by Dr. M√ºnch in his edition of the <i>Epistol√¶
  obscurorum Vivorum, aliaque √¶vi decimi sexti Monimenta rarissima</i>,
  Leipzig, 1827? If he had reprinted this very desirable appendix, it would
  have furnished him with the date "Anno <span
  class="scac">M.D.XX.</span>," which would have prevented him from
  assigning this satirical composition to the year "1521." (Einl. p.
  408.)</p>

  <p>(35.) A student can scarcely be considered moderately well versed in
  ancient ecclesiastical documents who has neither read nor heard of the
  <i>Somnium Viridarii</i>; and we may wonder at, and pity, the learned
  Goldast, for having fallen into the extravagant mistake of attributing
  this Latin translation of the celebrated Dialogue, <i>Le Songe du
  Verger</i>, to "Philotheus Achillinus, Consiliarius Regius." (<i>Monarch.
  S. Rom. Imper</i>. i. 58. Hanov. 1612.) The question arises, How was he
  misled? Was it not through a strange misconception of a sentence in the
  <i>Silva Nuptialis</i> of Nevizan, to which he refers in his preliminary
  "Dissertatio de Auctoribus?" This writer, who has been plentifully
  purified by the Roman <i>Index</i>, had cited the preface of an Italian
  poem, "Il Viridario," composed by his contemporary, Giovanni <span
  class="sc">Filoteo Achillini</span>; and is it thus that an author of the
  sixteenth century has got credit for an anonymous achievement of the
  fourteenth age? Goldastus has hardly been out-Heroded by those who have
  devised an individual named <i>Viridarius</i>, or "Le Sieur <i>du
  Vergier</i>." (See Baillet, <i>D√©guisemens des Auteurs</i>, p. 479., and
  M. De la Monnoye's note, pp. 501-2.)</p>

  <p>(36.) Is there not a transpositional misprint in the colophon of the
  old German <i>Life of S. Dorothea</i>, the so-called patroness of
  Prussia? For it would seem to be inevitable that we should endeavour to
  elicit 1492, and not 1512, from the following date: "Den Dingstag nach
  Gregory als man tzelete, <span class="scac">M.CCCC.</span> unde cxii."
  (Vid. Lilienthal, <i>Histor. B. Doroth</i>. p. 6. Dantisc., 1744.)</p>

  <p><i>Bishops' Lands</i>.&mdash;In the month of September, 1642, the

<h3>JOHN BUNYAN AND HIS PORTRAIT.&mdash;DID BUNYAN
KNOW HOBBES?</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 476. 518.; Vol. iii., p. 70.)</p>

  <p>The best portrait of John Bunyan was drawn and engraved by White, to
  the <i>Holy War</i>, 1682. The original drawing, and a fine impression of
  the engraving, is preserved in the illustrated Grainger's <i>History of
  England</i>, in the print-room at the British Museum. It was copied in
  folio for Bunyan's <i>Works</i>. It has been recently copied for Mr.
  Bogue's elegant edition of the <i>Pilgrim</i>, and for the first complete
  edition of Bunyan's <i>Works</i>, now publishing by Messrs. Blackie and
  Sons, Glasgow. A fac-simile was engraved for an edition of the
  <i>Pilgrim</i>, by Mr. Pickering, 8vo. 1849.</p>

  <p>That the great allegorist was not the author of <i>Heart's Ease</i> in
  <i>Heart Trouble</i> is perfectly clear, not only that the style is very
  different, but from the author being known. It was first published in
  1690, under the initials of J. B., and the Epistle is dated "From the
  house of my pilgrimage, March, 1690." Bunyan died in August, 1688. Mr.
  Palmer, in his <i>Calamy</i>, vol. ii. p.16., states that the author was
  James Birdwood.</p>

  <p>Whether Bunyan was acquainted with Hobbes depends upon the authority
  of a small volume of <i>Visions of Heaven and Hell</i>, published under
  the name of Bunyan. In this it is represented that he saw poor Hobbes in
  hell, and recognised an old acquaintance.</p>

  <p>The earliest edition of <i>The Visions</i> which I have been able to
  discover, is at "London: printed for Edward Midwinter, at the Looking
  Glass upon London Bridge, price, bound, one shilling;" without date. It
  was printed early in the reign of George I.; this is seen in an
  advertisement of books at the end, among which is <i>The Lives of the
  Monarchs of England to his present Majesty King George</i>. It is
  entitled, <i>The Visions of John Bunyan, being his last remains</i>.
  There is no account of either of this, or the <i>Heart's Ease</i>, in
  <i>The Struggler for the Preservation of Mr. John Bunyan's Labours</i>.
  This gives a list of forty-three works published by him, and of seventeen
  left by him at his decease for publication. If <i>The Visions</i> were
  written by him, it must have escaped the search of his widow and
  surviving friends; but the style at once proves that it was not a
  production of his prolific pen. Bunyan's style was remarkably simple and
  plain. The following phrases extracted from <i>The Visions</i> will carry
  conviction to every reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mormo's of a future state," "metempsychosis of nature," "nefandous
  villanies," "diurnal and annual," "my visive faculty," "soul-transparent
  and diaphonous," "translucid ray," "terrene enjoyments," "our minds are
  clarified," "types both of the ante and post-diluvian world," "the
  tenuity thereof," "the aereal heavens," "effluxes of divine glory," "all
  √¶nigmas," "corruscations of his divine nature," "Solomon's mystick
  epithalamium," "the epiphonema," "propinquity in nature," "diversified
  refractions," "too bright and too diaphonous," "sweet odes and
  eniphalamics," "amarantine crown," "bright corruscancy," "palinodies and
  elegies," "no cataplasm," "eccentricks quite exterminate," "mutual
  assassinates," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Such phrases and terms plain John Bunyan utterly despised. They prove,
  as does the whole plan of the treatise, that it must have been a very
  different man to the author of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> who wrote
  these <i>Visions</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span></p>

  <p>It is not likely that Hobbes and Bunyan were acquainted; they lived in
  distant parts of the country. Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim</i>, which was the
  foundation of his wide-spread fame, was not published till 1678, when the
  Leviathan philosopher was ninety years of age; he died in 1679. Hobbes'
  company were the learned and illustrious among men,&mdash;the Des
  Carteses, Gassendis, and Wallises of his age; while Bunyan associated
  with the despised Nonconformists. Nor is is likely that Bunyan read the
  <i>Leviathan</i>; Dent's <i>Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven, The Practice
  of Piety</i>, Fox's <i>Martyrs</i>, and, above all, his Bible,
  constituted his library during his imprisonment for conscience-sake,
  which lasted from 1660 to 1672. Had he suffered from Hobbes's philosophy,
  he would have proclaimed it upon the house-tops, especially in his
  <i>Grace Abounding</i>, that others might have been guarded from such
  dangerous scepticism. The <i>Vision</i> of Hobbes was doubtless intended
  to render the forgery more popular.</p>

<h3>THE MOTHER CHURCH OF THE SAXONS.</h3>

  <p>In "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" (Vol. ii., p. 478.)
  <span class="sc">Sir Henry Ellis</span> observes, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Although St. Martin's, Canterbury, is commonly called the mother
  church of England on account of its having been the first used here by
  Augustine, tradition represents, that when this missionary arrived in
  Kent, he found an ancient church on the site of what is now called St.
  Martin's."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Sir H. Ellis</span> adds, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A charter of King Canute's styles Saviour's church, Canterbury, the
  mother and mistress of all churches in the kingdom of
  England."-<i>√Ücclesia Salvatoris</i>, &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I conceive these accounts to be perfectly reconcilable. From Bede's
  <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> (b. i., caps. 25, 26.), we learn that, on
  the east side of Canterbury, in the year 597, there was a church
  dedicated to the honour of St. Martin, that was "built while the Romans
  were still in the island," some two hundred years before this date. St.
  Martin's was the church wherein Bertha, Queen of Kent, used to pray; she
  having been a Christian of the Royal Family of the Franks.</p>

  <p>It will, of course, be allowed that during the sixth, seventh, and
  eighth centuries, different saints were held in especial honour in
  different countries. For instance, not long after the arrival of the
  Roman missionaries in England, various churches and monasteries,&mdash;at
  Canterbury, Lindisfarne, Bamborough, Lichfield, Weremouth, and Jarrow,
  and the capital city of the Picts,&mdash;were wholly or partially named
  after St. Peter. When Naitan, King of the Picts, was about to build his
  church, he sought the assistance of the Abbot of Weremouth, a strong
  supporter of Roman observances, and "promised to dedicate the same in
  honour of St. Peter," and to follow the custom of the Roman church, in
  certain matters, which the subjects of his kingdom had protested against,
  for more than a hundred years.</p>

  <p>Now, on the occasion of Queen Bertha's leaving France, she was
  accompanied to England by a bishop of her native country, named Luidhard;
  and when it is remembered that they settled in Kent, amongst heathens of
  great superstition,&mdash;an example of which is recorded on the part of
  her own husband,&mdash;it is natural to suppose they would, in some
  public manner, seek the especial protection of the popular saint of
  France; and that saint was Martin. For so profound was the popular
  veneration which the Franks at one period offered to the power of Saint
  Martin, that they even computed ordinary occurrences and national events,
  by an era which commenced with the year of his death.<a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is therefore very probable that the public act of reverence just
  alluded to, consisted in a new dedication of the repaired church, by
  adding to the ancient name that of St. Martin.</p>

  <p>That a practice of altering the names of sacred edifices in this
  manner was common at the date under consideration, cannot be questioned.
  For example, Bishop Aidan, about the year 652, built a church in the
  island of Lindisfarne, the name of which is now unknown. This structure,
  however, having been destroyed by a fire, his successor, Finan, erected
  another on the same site, and apparently of the same name. But when a
  second fire destroyed this church also, in some five and twenty or thirty
  years, "a larger church" was erected on the old site, and gratefully
  "dedicated in honour of St. Peter," by Theodore of Roman appointment,
  "the first archbishop whom all the English church obeyed." (<i>Bede</i>,
  iii. 17. and 25., and iv. 2.) Here, then, a new name was given to a
  church on the site of a former one of different appellation; and in
  Lichfield, we have two examples of similar alterations in the names of
  churches; one St. Chad's Church, Stow, and the other, the cathedral. On
  the site of the former, according to Bede, Bishop Chad built a St. Mary's
  Church, hard by which he was buried; "but afterwards, when the church of
  the most holy prince of the apostles, Peter, was built, his bones were
  translated into it." (<i>Ecc. History</i>, iv. 3.) That is to say, when
  Chad was canonised, his remains were removed to the site of the present
  cathedral, as relics over which the principal church of the Mercian
  kingdom was to be erected.</p>

  <p>Throughout the various documents relating to this church, which are
  preserved in Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, vol. iii. pp. 219-255, Savoy
  edition, <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>the cathedral is generally styled the church
  of St. Mary and St. Chad. And again, on a recently discovered seal of the
  dean and chapter, engraved some two hundred years after Stephen's reign,
  the inscription is this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="scac">S' DECANI ET CAPL'I ECCLE'IE SCE MARIE ET SCI
  CEDDE LYCHFELD' AD CAS</span>."<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But in a grant from King Stephen to Bishop Roger de Clinton, who
  commenced the present fabric, it is simply styled <i>ecclesia Sancti
  Cedd√¶ de Lichfield</i>; and in the year 1341 a document was addressed
  <i>Decano et Capitulo ecclesi√¶ Sancti Cedd√¶ Lych'</i>, as may be learned
  from the <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. ii. p. 2.</p>

  <p>We thus perceive, that the original name of Lichfield Cathedral has
  been dropped for centuries, and so has that of the church which Bishop
  Chad built in honour of the Virgin Mary at Stow; for this Church has, for
  a long time, been known only by the name of Stow Church, or by that of
  St. Chad's, Stow.</p>

  <p>And in this manner, I fancy, may be reconciled the different names of
  Saviour's, or St. Saviour's, Canterbury, and St. Martin's, Canterbury;
  both alluding to the same church, <span class="scac">THE MOTHER
  CHURCH</span> of <i>Saxon</i> England.</p>

  <p><i>The Frozen Horn</i> (Vol. ii., p. 262.; Vol. iii., p.
  25.).&mdash;In an old edition of <i>Hudibras</i> now before me, I find
  the following note on the lines quoted by J. M. G.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some report that in Nova Zembla and Greenland men's words are wont to
  be frozen in the air, and at the thaw may be heard."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The application of the idea by Charles Dickens, in his <i>Old
  Curiosity Shop</i>, is also, I think, extremely felicitous.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Don't be frightened, mistress,' said Quilp, after a pause. 'Your son
  knows me: I don't eat babies; I don't like 'em. It will be as well to
  stop that young screamer though, in case I should be tempted to do him a
  mischief. Holloa, Sir! will you be quiet?' <i>Little Jacob stemmed the
  course of two tears which he was squeezing out of his eyes, and instantly
  subsided into a silent horror.... The moment their</i> [Quilp and

  <p><i>To Pose.</i>&mdash;In Vol. ii., p. 522., your correspondent F. R.
  A. points out some passages in which the word "posing" appears to be used
  in a sense equivalent to "parsing." Neither the etymology nor the exact
  meaning of the word "to pose," are easy to determine. It seems to be
  abbreviated from the old verb "to appose;" which meant, to set a task, to
  subject to an examination or interrogatory; and hence to perplex, to
  embarrass, to puzzle. The latter is the common meaning of the word <i>to
  pose</i>; thus in Crabbe's <i>Parish Register</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then by what name th' unwelcome guest to call,</p>
      <p>Was long a question, and <i>it posed them all</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hence, too, the common expression, that a question which it is
  difficult to answer, or an argument which seems to decide the
  controversy, is a <i>poser</i>. The word "posing" in the passages cited
  by F. R. A. may refer to the examination of the pupil by the teacher of
  grammar. Thus, Fuller, in his <i>Worthies</i>, art. Norfolk, says
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The University appointed Dr. Cranmer, afterwards Archbishop of
  Canterbury, to be the <i>poser-general</i> of all candidates in

  <p><i>Culprits torn by Horses</i> (Vol. ii., p. 480.).&mdash;In reply to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Jackson's</span> question respecting culprits torn
  by horses, I beg to inform him that Robert Fran√ßois Damiens was the last
  criminal thus executed in France. He suffered on the 28th March, 1757,
  for an attempt on the life of Louis XV. The awful penalty of the law was
  carried out in complete conformity with the savage precedents of former
  centuries. Not one of the preparatory barbarities of question, ordinary
  and extraordinary, or of the accompanying atrocities of red-hot pincers,
  melted lead, and boiling oil, was omitted. The agony of the wretched man
  lasted for an hour and a half, and was witnessed, as Mercier informs us,
  by all the best company in Paris.</p>

  <p>The men amused their leisure with cards, while waiting, as he says,
  for the boiling oil; and the women were the last to turn their eyes from
  the hideous spectacle. Your correspondent may be glad to be informed that
  the same punishment was inflicted on Poltrot de M√©r√© for the murder of
  the Duke of Guise, in 1563; on Salc√®de, in 1582, for conspiring against
  the Duke of Alen√ßon; on Brilland, in 1588, for poisoning the Prince de
  Cond√©; on Bourgoing, Prior of the Jacobins, as an accessory to the crime
  of Jaques Cl√©ment, in 1590; and on Ravaillac, for the murder of Henry IV.
  in 1610. These, with the case of Jean Chastel, are all of which I am
  aware. If any of your readers can add to the list, I shall feel
  obliged.</p>

  <p>As I am upon the subject of judicial horrors, I would ask, whether any
  of your correspondents can supply me with a reference to the case of a
  <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span>woman executed, I think in Paris, and, if my
  recollection serves, for a systematic series of infanticides.</p>

  <p>She was put to death by being suspended over a fire in an iron cage,
  in which a number of wild cats were shut up with her.</p>

  <p>I read the story many years ago, and for some time have been vainly
  endeavouring to recover it.</p>

  <p class="author">J. S.

  <p><i>Torn by Horses</i> (Vol. ii., p. 522.).&mdash;This cruel mode of
  execution was practised both in antiquity and the middle ages. Livy,
  speaking of Tullus Hostilius, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Exinde, duabus admotis quadrigis, in currus earum distentum illigat
  Mettum; deinde in diversum iter equi concitati, lacerum in utroque curru
  corpus, qua inh√¶serant vinculis membra, portantes. Avertere omnes a tant√¢
  f&oelig;didate spectaculi oculos."&mdash;L. i., c. 28.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Livy adds, that this was the first and last example of so savage a
  punishment among the Romans. The punishment, however, must have been
  well-known in antiquity, as it is alluded to by Seneca among the tortures
  which accompanied death.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cogita hoc loco carcerem, et cruces, et equleos, et uncum; et adactum
  per medium hominem, qui per os emergat, stipitem; <i>et distracta in
  diversum actis curribus membra</i>."&mdash;Epist. xiv. 4.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Grimm (<i>Deutsche Rechtsalterth√ºmer</i>, p. 692.) quotes the
  following instance of this punishment from Gregory of Tours, <i>Hist.
  France</i>, iii. 7.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Puellas crudelinece interfecerunt ita ut ligatis brachiis super
  equorum cervicibus, ipsique acerrimo moti stimulo per diversa petentes
  diversas in partes feminas diviserunt"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He adds that it occurs frequently in the legends of the Carolingian
  period. Thus Turpin, c. 26., describes as follows the punishment of the
  traitor Gannalon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Jussit illum Carolus quatuor equis ferocissimis totius exercitus
  alligari, et super eos quatuor sessores agitantes contra quatuor plagas
  c&oelig;li, et sic dign√¢ morte discerptus interiit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Almost all cruel punishments have been used in the East, and it is not
  improbable that execution by means of horses may be mentioned in some
  oriental narrative.</p>

  <p><i>The Conquest</i> (Vol. ii., p. 440.).&mdash;In <i>Cambria

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sigilla nostra apposuimus in Castro nostro de Burgavenny vicessimo
  secundo die Julii, anno regni Regis Henrici sexti, post <i>Conquestum</i>

  <p><i>Mayors&mdash;their correct Prefix</i> (Vol. i., p.
  380.).&mdash;Since propounding my Query in Vol. i., p. 380., relative to
  this subject, I have to inform your readers, that I have been favoured
  with the opinion of gentlemen very high in official authority on all
  points connected with heraldry and the rules of precedence; which is,
  that the proper style of the mayor of a borough is "the worshipful;" and
  they are further of opinion, that there can be no ground for styling the
  mayor of a city "the right worshipful."</p>

  <p><i>True Blue</i> (Vol. iii., p. 27.).&mdash;On the origin of this
  expression, I must claim the right to dissent from your correspondent G.
  F. G., who appears to have fallen into the error of confining a form of
  very wide application to one particular case, in which he discovers a
  trifling coincidence of fact. The connexion of the colour blue with truth
  is of very ancient date, of which the following may for the present
  suffice as an example:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And by hire beddes hed she made a mew</p>
      <p>And covered it with velouettes blew,</p>
      <p>In signe of trouth, that is in woman sene."</p>
      <p class="i8">Chaucer, <i>Squiere's Tale</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Blue, in the early practice of the tinctorial art, appears to have
  been the most humble of the colours in use, and the least affected by any
  external influence; and, down to the present day, if certain tints of
  recent invention be excepted, the same character may be claimed for it.
  What then more natural, than that it should be taken as the type of
  immutability, or that every party, political or religious, should in turn
  assume it as the badge of honesty of purpose, and of firm adherence to
  their principles?</p>

  <p><i>Modum Promissionis</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 279, 347, 468.).&mdash;This

  <p><i>Fronte capillat√¢, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 8. 43.).&mdash;The

  correspondent G. A. S.</p>

  <p><i>Cross between a Wolf and a Hound</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  39.).&mdash;There is no doubt that a dog and a wolf are capable of
  breeding together. The fact is well known, and has been long ascertained.
  See <i>Penny Cyclop√¶dia</i>, art. "Dog." The only question is whether the
  offspring of this cross is a mule, and, like other mules, incapable of
  continuing its race; or whether it is prolific? The latter position is
  maintained by Mr. Bell, in his <i>History of British Quadrupeds</i>. "The
  dog and wolf will readily breed together (he says), <i>and their progeny
  is fertile</i>." But query, can any authentic instance be produced of a
  cross between a dog and a wolf, which has produced a prolific animal?</p>

  <p class="author">L.

  <p>Professor Thomas Bell states that the dog and wolf will readily breed
  with each other, and that their progeny thus obtained will again mingle
  with the dog.</p>

  <p><i>Touching for the Evil</i> (Vol. iii., p. 42.).&mdash;I have seen an
  illuminated MS. containing the form of prayer in use previous to the
  Reformation. As far as I remember, the MS. in question must have been of
  the fifteenth century. Where it may now be found I am not aware. At the

  Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>A somewhat curious field for inquiry on this subject is opened by a

  <p><i>Separation of Sexes in Church</i> (Vol. ii., p. 94.).&mdash;This

  <p><i>Defender of the Faith</i> (Vol. iii., p. 9.).&mdash;By a hasty
  perusal of the letter of <span class="sc">Col. Anstruther</span> in your
  number of the 4th of January, I perceive that some doubt has been raised
  whether any of our sovereigns have used the title of Defender of the
  Faith, prior to the time of King Henry VIII.</p>

  <p>If you will refer to the forth part of Prynne's <i>Institutes</i>, pp.
  229-30, and 295-6-7, you will find set out at full length divers letters
  close and patent from King Richard II. in the 6th, 11th, and 19th years
  of his reign, for suppressing the heresies of Wickliff and his followers.
  These letters are addressed to the Chancellor of the University of
  Oxford, William Archbishop of Canterbury (Courtney), and to Ralfe
  Crombewell, Chivalier, and John Lekyll, and the Mayor and Bailiffs of
  Nottingham, in which King Richard II. styles himself thus&mdash;"Nos Zelo

  <p>Lincoln Chambers, Chancery Lane, Jan. 14. 1851.</p>

  <p><i>Epigram on Synod of Dort</i> (Vol. iii., p. 23.).&mdash;The
  statement in the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, that this epigram was
  made <i>in England</i>, is probably taken from Mosheim (<i>Eccl.
  Hist</i>.), who says the same; but his authority Neal (<i>Hist. of the
  Puritans</i>) does not say that it was made <i>in England</i>; and one
  can hardly read the sentence in which he quotes it without feeling
  satisfied that he did not know <i>who</i> made it. After stating that the
  proceedings of the synod were much approved of by the English divines,
  and quoting expressions of Mr. Baxter and the learned Jacobus Capella in
  its favour, he proceeds&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"P. du Moulin, Paulus Servita, and the author of the life of Waleus,
  speak the same language. But <i>others</i> poured contempt upon the
  Synod, or burlesqued their proceedings in the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Dordrechti Synodus, nodus; chorus integer, √¶ger;</p>
      <p>Conventus, ventus; sessio stramen. Amen.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Lewis du Moulin, with all the favourers of the Arminian doctrine, as
  Heylin, Womeck, Brandt, &amp;c., charge them with partiality and
  unjustifiable severity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When a writer, in the midst of a shower of authorities, refers a
  particular expression to "others," it may almost be laid down as a rule,
  that he does not know whose property it is. Here, therefore, the inquiry
  seems brought to a dead stop, in this tract at least.</p>

  <p class="author">B. R. I.

  <p><i>Parish Register Tax</i> (Vol. ii., p. 10.).&mdash;In our register,
  Hawarden, I find the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"October, 1783. On the 2nd of this month the Act commenced which
  layeth a duty of threepence upon every Registry of a Burial, except a
  <i>Pauper's</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Oct. 1. 1794. The duty of threepence on each Registry of Births,
  Deaths, and Marriages, imposed by Act of Parliament, commencing October
  2. 1783, ceased this day."</p>

  <p>During this interval many burials are marked <i>paupers</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Dugdale, in relating the same matter, adds that Rigby not only
  exposed them to sale, but <i>found purchasers</i> also; and what is more,
  had actually contracted with two merchants for them; and for that reason

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>When a work of such general reference as a Peerage, which is wanted
  upon every library table, and in every club and reading-room "where men
  do congregate;" which is, at the same time, from its nature, open to the
  criticism of hundreds of critics,&mdash;when a work of this nature and of
  such extent as <i>Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the
  Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire</i> bears on its title-page
  the brief but expressive words "<i>Thirteenth Edition</i>," it has
  obviously long outlived the time when any question can exist as to its
  merits. These have long been recognised by those best able to appreciate
  them, namely, the noble personages to whose history, and the history of
  whose descent and collateral branches, it is especially devoted; and
  whose personal communications have served to procure for the present work
  the merit by which it seeks to distinguish itself from all similar
  productions, namely, by its greater fullness of detail and its extreme
  accuracy.</p>

  <p>A TABLE OF ANTI-LOGARITHMS.</p>

  <p>Containing to Seven Places of Decimals, natural Numbers, answering to
  all Logarithms from 00001 to 99999; and an improved Table of Gauss's
  Logarithms, by which may be found the Logarithm to the sum or difference
  of Two Quantities where Logarithms are given: preceded by an
  Introduction, containing also the History of Logarithms, their
  Construction, and the various Improvements made therein since their
  invention. By <span class="sc">Herschell E. Filipowski.</span></p>

  <p>The publisher, having purchased the copyright and stereotype places of
  these Tables, (published a few months ago at 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>,) is
  enabled to offer a corrected edition at the above reduced price.</p>

  <p><i>Testimonial of Augustus de Morgan, Esq.</i></p>

  <p>"I have examined the proofs of Mr. Filipowski's Table of
  Anti-Logarithms, and of Gauss's Logarithms, and also the plan of his
  proposed table of Annuities for three lives, constructed from the
  Carlisle Table.</p>

  <p>"The table of Anti-Logarithms is, I think, all that could be wished,
  in extent, in structure, and in typography. For its extent it is unique
  among modern Tables. Of accuracy I cannot speak, of course; but this
  being supposed, I have no hesitation in recommending it without
  qualification.</p>

  <p>"The form in which Gauss's Tables are arranged will be a matter of
  opinion. I can only say that Mr. Filipowski's Table is used with ease, as
  I have found upon trial; and that its extent, as compared with other
  tables, and particularly with other <span class="scac">FIVE-FIGURE</span>
  tables, of the same kind, will recommend it. I desire to confine myself
  to testifying to the facility with which this table can be used;
  comparison with other forms, as to <span class="scac">RELATIVE</span>
  facility, being out of the question on so short a trial.</p>

  <p>"On the table of Annuities for three lives, there is hardly occasion
  to say anything. All who are conversant with Life Contingencies are well
  aware how much it is wanted.</p>
